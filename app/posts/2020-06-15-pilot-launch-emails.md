We sent the following emails to 12 local authorities and 18 trusts to launch the BT hotspot pilot on 15 June.

## Email to local authorities

{% from "email/macro.njk" import appEmail %}
{{ appEmail({
  subject: "Increasing internet access for vulnerable and disadvantaged children",
  content: "We know internet access supports remote education, as well as virtual contact between children, their social workers and other services. That’s why we’re providing laptops, tablets and 4G wireless routers to disadvantaged families. (Find out more about this on [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/get-help-with-technology-for-remote-education-during-coronavirus-covid-19).)

We also know some that children don’t have reliable internet access, and we’re now acting to change this.

### How we can improve children’s internet access

The Department for Education has teamed up with BT to give young people free access to BT wifi hotspots. BT will create a set of hotspot log-ins that young people can activate through name/password combinations.

For children who can’t connect to a BT hotspot because of where they live, we hope to increase data allowances on their, or their family’s, mobile devices for free.

### Who can get help

Increased internet access is available to families with children from early years up to 16, and care leavers up to 25 if they:

* don’t have access to a [fixed broadband connection](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/phones-telecoms-and-internet/advice-for-consumers/advice/broadband-speeds/broadband-basics)
* cannot afford the additional data needed to access educational resources or social care services

### How you can help

As a local authority, you’re responsible for:

* care leavers and children with a social worker
* all children in LA-maintained schools up to 16

We’re now asking you to:

* confirm how many children and young people you’re responsible for need increased internet access
* confirm how many of these children have access to a BT hotspot (based on their location)

^ Please get back to us by Monday 29 June 2020.

Here’s the process we’d like you to follow:

### Step one

Liaise with social care teams and schools to understand how many children and young people need increased internet access, based on the criteria above.

We’ve drafted a [suggested email for you to send to schools](((link_to_file))).

### Step two

Find out how many of those children and young people can connect to a BT hotspot by getting them to:

* do a postcode check on https://www.btwifi.com/find/, or
* check whether BT wifi is in their list of available networks at home

We’re aware that some children won’t be able to access BT hotspots and we’ll contact you separately about our plans to support them.

### Step three

Email [email@address](mailto:email@address) to let us know:

* how many children and young people need increased internet access
* how many of those children and young people could use a BT hotspot

Please get back to us by Monday 29 June so we can send you the hotspot log-in details for you to pass on to schools.

### If you have questions

If you have any questions about this process, please email [email@address](mailto:email@address) using the subject line ‘Increasing internet access’. We’ll get back to you as soon as we can."

You don’t need to let us know about children who have a social worker, as local authorities are submitting information on their behalf.
