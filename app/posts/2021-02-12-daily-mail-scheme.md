title: Opting in to the Daily Mail’s donated devices scheme
description: How schools and responsible bodies will get these donated devices delivered to them
date: 2021-02-12
---

The Daily Mail is running a Computers For Kids scheme through its Mail Force charity. They are collecting donations for new devices and donations of old devices that will be refurbished.

The Department for Education is using its Get help with technology service as a way for schools and trusts to opt in and receive these devices. It must be clear that this is not a DfE scheme, and that our role in the distribution and allocation of these devices is minimal.

There are two journeys:

- school journey
- responsible body journey, where schools are being managed centrally
