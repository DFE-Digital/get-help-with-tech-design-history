A summary from the [research playback](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Cm6eYM5yNifiZx-ZTiBBBjP_YAN69k11x-bt0wf0lBs/edit).

On pupil connectivity:

* Many schools and trusts are already tracking pupils’ online engagement. Those with budget are taking action (at their own expense) to fill the device and connectivity gaps
* People in schools care about, and feel responsible to, the communities they serve. They have a need to maintain positive relationships
* Connectivity at home is not a simple binary issue
* A pupil’s domestic situation will have a large bearing on how and when they are likely to be online (and with what device)

On our guidance:

* DfE guidance about the scheme and eligibility is generally clear
* Set-up instructions need to be very simple for families with low literacy, or those for whom English is not their first language

On BT wifi coverage, people had different takes depending on their technical knowledge:

* MATs and schools are concerned about the coverage and reliability of BT Wifi hotspots nationwide
* They may also be making broad, over-optimistic, assumptions about urban coverage

Other findings:

* Safeguarding children online is vital, so LAs and MATs are keen to understand what content filtering exists for BT Wifi Hotspot users
* The method for distributing logins is likely vary greatly, depending on the local context, but ideally should not to be too labour- intensive
* The summer break may pose a capacity issue for some (but not all) schools

## User needs

As a local authority, MAT, school I need to:

* ensure all the pupils in my schools and academies have fast and reliable internet access at home, so that the digital divide and any resulting educational attainment gap is minimised

### Identifying pupils in need

* have clear guidance on pupil eligibility, so that we can identify eligible pupils in a way that does not significantly add to the burden on teachers and admin staff
* be confident in the accuracy of the BT postcode checker, so that we can correctly identify eligible pupils within a Hotspot area

### Distributing BT logins and vouchers

* be able to distribute logins in a straightforward way, so that we can facilitate access for eligible children as soon as possible, particularly with the summer break approaching

### Getting and staying online

* be able to provide simple set-up instructions to families, so that those with lower literacy levels or for whom English is a second language do not struggle to get online
* know there is suitable content filtering within a BT Wifi Hotspot, so that we can safeguard children's presence online
* be confident that pupils with logins/ vouchers will actually be able to access BT Wifi Hotspots, so we can maximise our chances of success in getting pupils online
* understand what alternative connectivity options are available from DfE, and how we can make use of them, so that no child is disadvantaged by not living within a BT Wifi Hotspot
* understand what tech support is available, so that school staff are not unduly burdened with support queries during the summer break
