A first pass at capturing the data we need from responsible bodies:

* how many eligible young people they know about
* how many of them can access a BT hotspot
* who needs additional mobile data

Things these designs are missing:

* guidance on collecting "how many" numbers
* support page for changing those numbers after submission
* easier choice of mobile network
* explanation of data offer for each network
* what happens when network isnâ€™t part of offer
* questions about who is the device owner
* questions about privacy of end user
