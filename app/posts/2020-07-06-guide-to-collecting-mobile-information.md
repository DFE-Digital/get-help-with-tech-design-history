title: Guide to collecting mobile information
description: Using a guide rather than a walkthrough

Rather than a [prescriptive and complex to build walkthrough](/school-walkthrough-with-families/), we opted to give schools the guidance to capture the information we need.

This guide doesn’t cover the BT wifi offer.

They can:

* read this guidance ahead of time
* get the context they need before contacting families
* jump to the section they need help with

They still need to:

* capture the data themselves somehow, rather than the data coming directly to us
* pass that data to us, probably via trust or local authority in a spreadsheet
* identify the correct mobile offer to tell the account holder

There’s risk that they capture the data without adequate validation. We hope to mitigate that with a spreadsheet template containing some validation.

{% from "screenshots/macro.njk" import appScreenshots with context %}
{{ appScreenshots({
  items: [{
      text: "Overview",
      img: { src: "01-overview.png" }
    }, {
      text: "Asking for network",
      img: { src: "02-asking-for-network.png" }
    }, {
      text: "Telling about offer",
      img: { src: "03-telling-about-offer.png" }
    }, {
      text: "Asking for account holder",
      img: { src: "04-asking-for-account-holder.png" }
    }, {
      text: "Privacy",
      img: { src: "05-privacy.png" }
    }]
}) }}
