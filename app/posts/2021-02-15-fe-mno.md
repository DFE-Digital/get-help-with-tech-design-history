title: Excluding networks from MNO offer for students over 16
description: giffgaff, O2 and Tesco Mobile do not support requests for these students

We are rolling out the MNO offer to all further education organisations. However, contractually, three networks have not agreed to take part. We need to warn schools that these networks do not accept requests from users who are over 16.

Where possible, for instance when an FE college is making a request, and when we know all students will be over 16, we can block these requests and show an error message. This sort of validation cannot be applied to schools with sixth-forms, we wonâ€™t know the age of the end user, and we do not want that information.

1. Show an eligibility message to all users under the "Check who is eligible" heading
2. Show a warning before uploading a spreadsheet to further education organisations, and any centrally managed responsible that is responsible for one or more further education organisations (for example schools with sixth forms)
3. Hide giffgaff, O2 and Tesco Mobile from the list of networks for a further education organisation
4. Add validation to prevent uploading a giffgaff, O2 or Tesco Mobile request for a further education organisation
